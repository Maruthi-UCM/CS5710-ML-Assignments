# Question 1 – 
Source code git link: https://github.com/Maruthi-UCM/CS5710-ML-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment-2/Que-1.ipynb

To display the given pattern, we had made use of for loop and condition statements inside the for loop.
First initialized the number of lines to be displayed in the pattern (this can be also modified to be taken as input), 
next we ran a for loop to iterate for the lines and every time we checked a couple of conditions and printed the ‘*’ no of stars in the line as show below.
 

# Question 2 – 
Source code git link: https://github.com/Maruthi-UCM/CS5710-ML-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment-2/Que-2.ipynb

Here we were asked to print the elements in the odd indices of the given list. 
First, we initialized the given list. Next, we traversed through the list using the for loop and using the condition inside the loop to check if the index is odd or even and printed the element which is in odd index. 

# Question 3 – 
Source code git link: https://github.com/Maruthi-UCM/CS5710-ML-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment-2/Que-3.ipynb

Here we were asked to print the data types of the elements in the given list correspondingly in a list.
For this we first traversed the list and using a for loop and for every element we used the ‘type()’ function to get the datatype and appended into a list initialized earlier.


# Question 4 – 
Source code git link: https://github.com/Maruthi-UCM/CS5710-ML-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment-2/Que-4.ipynb

Here we were asked to read list from the user and remove the duplicates in the list and give the list with unique elements as output. 
First, we read the list of elements from the user. For removing duplicates we can make use of ‘set()’ function to remove the duplicates from the list and convert it back to list using ‘list()’ function.

# Question 5 – 
Source code git link: https://github.com/Maruthi-UCM/CS5710-ML-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment-2/Que-5.ipynb
 
Here we were asked to read a string from the user and given the count of capital letters and lower-case letters in the string. 
First, we read the input string from the user using ‘input()’ function and also initialize two variables to use as counters for capital letter and lowercase letters.
To traverse on the string we can use a for loop and make use of conditions inside to check if the character is lowercase or not using ‘.islower()’ function and also ‘.isalpha()’ function to check if the character is an alphabet or not.
We ever the respective condition is true we do increment to the respective counter we initialized earlier.
